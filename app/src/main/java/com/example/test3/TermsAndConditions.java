                "Survey Speeding: A survey may have an estimated time period in which the survey is to be completed for verification and safety purposes. When you complete the survey within a time frame that does not fall within the estimated time limit, you may be considered not to have completed the survey and therefore may not obtain any opportunities to participate. In addition, you can be terminated from your membership with Bheemcash.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Red Herring Questions: A survey may include the same or similar questions multiple times, or may allow you to pick a specific answer (so-called Red Herring Questions) to ensure that you are being honest and/or reading all of the survey questions carefully. If your responses to such Red Herring Questions suggest that you are not being honest and/or reading all of the survey questions carefully, you may not qualify for the survey and will therefore obtain no rewards for your participation. Alternatively, we can cancel your membership and delete your account.\n" +
